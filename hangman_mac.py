#SDM: make a hangman game where each part of the game is written as a function, and the main game loop is run inside
#of a function which calls all the other smaller functions. Give every function on a docstring which explains all the inputs, 
#the general purpose of the function, and any outputs. If the secret word to guess is "apple", then the initial blanks shown to 
#the player should appear like "_ _ _ _ _", and then the player will be given the option to put in single letter guess. If the
#guess is correct, the blanks will be updated, like so "_ p p _ _" for the initial guess "p", else, if the user is wring, then 1
#life point will be subtracted from the initial 5, and the game will display a win message if the player completely guesses the enitre word
#before running out of life points, else, the game will display a lose message if the player runs out of life points first.
